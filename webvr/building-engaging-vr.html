				<p>Hi I am Ada from Samsung, i'm here to talk to you about Virtual Reality specifically virtual reality on the web.</p>
				<p>The topics I hope to cover are some of the advice I have picked up by building scenes for VR</p>
				<p>Just a warning I am not a graphical designer this is just some practical advice I picked up along the way.</p>
				<p>I recently was the judge on a VR demo competition. So I would like to highlight some of the things that can be implemented to really bring a scene together.</p>
				<p>These tips tend to fit into one of these categories:</p>
				<h3>Selling the illusion</h3>
				<p>We tend to take for granted that Stereoscopic VR will feel 3D because it is stereoscopic but steroscopic vision is only one of many cues the mind uses to detect depth. By using more visual cues we can improve the illusion to help the user forget that what they're seeing is not real.
				</p>
				<h3>Making the user comfortable</h3>
				<p>It is very easy for VR to make a user feel unwell. It is important that they feel comfortable in VR so they can look back on your experience with positive feelings and will want to come back.</p>

				<h3>Why are you building the scene?</h3>
				<p>This is potentially the biggest flaw in VR scenes.
					What does VR offer you which a 2D screen does not, I have seen many scenes where VR was used just to be VR but would have been much better on just a normal phone screen.</p>
					<p>If VR isn't giving you anything all you are doing is making your content harder for users to use.</p>
				<h3>What do you want the user to do?</h3>
				<p>Your "call to action", whether art, educational, or advertisement you are trying to get the user to *do* something. For example by giving this talk I am hoping you go out and build some cool VR.</p>
				<p>Do you want the user to think about something inparticular? To remembmer something from your scene? To use your scene to perform an action?</p>
				<p>Use this to determine the elements in the scene the user should be focusing on.</p>
				<h3>What should the user be focusing on?</h3>
				<p>A single 360 degree scene can hold vast amounts of content. But the user won't have the attention or will power to look at everything it is really important to bring attention certain elements.</p>

				<h1>Should VR need to be realistic?</h1>
				<p>I would argue NO! A scene with a lot of graphical realism will suffer.</p>
				<p>Difficult to do right and very hard to do performantly. The still behind me is from final fantasy spirits within, this was considered "photo realistic".</p>
				<p>A stylistic appoach, will look good on lower end and high end devices and be a great excuse to remove lots of visual clutter allowing you to focus on delivering the message you want.</p>
				<p>Something which is computationally expensive but can raelly make a scene feel great without cluttering it is physics. Adding physics makes a scene feel alive and engaging without too much visual clutter. But it is too expensive to add to everything to carefully choose what gets the fancy physics animation and what can fake it.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Graphical Realism</li>
					<li>Physical Realism</li>
					<li>Realistic Physics? Trade off between performance and </li>
					<li>How abstract, can you be?</li>
				</ul>

					<h1>Filling your scene with stuff</h1>
					<p>Reently I have judged a few hackathons where first time VR developers have submitted an entry. This is advice I would love to give them to make their scenes more comfortable to use or feel 500% better with a shorter amount of work.</p>
					<p>The skybox</p>
					<p>The floor provides several key pieces of subconcious information to the user, how tall they are in the scene, how far away stuff is.</p>
					<p>I often see scenes with no concept of floor just floating in space, that is a valid creative choice but you sacrifice a lot of readibility by doing that.</p>
					<p>Another mistake is to just do a single coloured floor. With no texture this unfortunately breaks the stereoscopic effect as often it is one colour and ends up being visually confusing. A texture will give the user scale and help the stereoscopic effect</p>

				<h1>Lighting and Colours</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Lights can be used to approximate real world lighting</li>
					<li>Shadows, fixed and dynamic, depth illusion and sell the scene.</li>
					<li>Saturation in VR, feeling of leaving recroom.</li>
					<li>Make items visually distinct</li>
					<li>Highlight interactable elements</li>
					<li>Give hints to how to play [this cat has a quest]</li>
					<li>Use black and white sparingly as you cannot get brighter or darker</li>
					<li>Gradients and textures are good</li>
					<li>Large monotone areas can make the user get lost, as well as not being interesting</li>
					<li>Overly detailed textures can be too noisy [where's wally]</li>
					<li>Gradients provide a nice middle ground</li>
					<li>Picking a skybox</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Using motion</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Moving objects</li>
					<li>Moving things draw the eye</li>
					<li>Even in a VR diarama some motion can bring the scene to life.</li>
					<li>Motion in response to a user's gesture implies it is interactive</li>
					<li>Moving the camera</li>
					<li>Make it user triggered so they can brace them selves</li>
					<li>Give warning, wind up the motion, shrink field of view whilst moving</li>
					<li>Teleporting can lead to disorientation</li>
					<li>Bobbing and shaking can induce nausea</li>
				</ul>
